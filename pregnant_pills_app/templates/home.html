            own list of pills, 
            which you are taking during your pregnancy.
            It is very useful for your gynecologist and in case of hospital stay. 
            You can specify if the pill is rutine or special.
            Rutine pills are vitamins and other complex nutrients,
            which you should take every day in pregnant.
            Special pills you use if you have illness 
            for example flu, heartburn or gestational diabetes.
            You can download your pill's list as PDF Report.  </p>
